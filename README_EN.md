# SimpleMusclesSensor

This is a simple muscle activity sensor based on LM358, that works on the capacitive principle.

# Sensor electrodes constructions

# Schematic

This is a very simple sensor of muscle activity based on a general-purpose operational amplifier LM358N, three electrodes are used (IN-, IN+ and 3.3V reference, connected through a series-connected resistor with a rating of 2 MÎ©), the opamp is connected according to the negative feedback loop scheme and has a gain of 1 to 110.
