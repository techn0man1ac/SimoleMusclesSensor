# SimoleMusclesSensor

This is a very simple muscle activity sensor.

# Schematic

This is a very simple muscle activity sensor base on LM358N, it uses three electrodes(IN-, IN+ and 3.3V reference supplied to the third electrode in series with a 2 MÎ© resistor), negative feedback loop and gain 1 to 110.
